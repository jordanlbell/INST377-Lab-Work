        The leftmost image is a jpg of a smiling mochi. It has a strange circle going around the outside of the mochi. 
        The second image is a GIF of a smiling mochi that is bouncing up and down.
        The third image is a png of a smiling mochi. The image is mostly plain. 
        The 4th image is an SVG of a smiling mochi. It is much smaller than the others and is surrounded by dotted lines.

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.
